From standard pallet rack systems, to complex pick-to belt towers, AS/RS installations or Rack Supported Buildings, FRAZIER?s expert team of engineers help each customer design the best, most cost-effective Storage Solutions.

We made a fundamental decision when developing our manufacturing capabilities, to use structural steel instead of inferior roll-formed products. Since then, FRAZIER has become the leading producer of structural steel pallet rack systems with the most production capacity in the industry.

Structural steel is far more abuse-resistant? And we guarantee our storage rack systems to last! This is why our customers are so loyal. They rely on us to produce quality storage rack systems that hold up in the busiest warehouse environments. It?s true, structural used to be more expensive than roll-formed, but FRAZIER has consistently driven these costs down without sacrificing the quality and strength of our pallet rack. In fact, long-term costs of FRAZIER storage rack systems are actually LESS since structural components are more abuse-resistant and do not need continual replacement as do roll-formed uprights.
